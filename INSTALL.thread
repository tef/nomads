This file contains directives for installing the Logical State Thread
package for SICStus Prolog 2.1 and 3.

For SICStus 3
-------------

Move the two files threads.pl and versions.pl from the directory Source
to a directory SICStus Prolog recognizes as a library, i.e one that is
search when a directive like :- ensure_loaded(library(threads)) is
isued.  That's all!

If you cannot find such a directory you can easily make SICStus Prolog
recognize any directory of your choice as a library directory.  Just put
the following lines in you ~/.sicstusrc file.

%----------------------------------------------------------
% Adding my own library:

:- asserta( user:library_directory('<path-to-my-own-library-dir>') ).
%----------------------------------------------------------

where <path-to-my-own-library-dir> could be something like
~andka/lib/sicstus.  See the manual on user:library_directory/1 for a
more thorough expalanaton.


For SICStus 2.1
---------------

Install as for SICStus 3.

For non-ISO Prologs such as SICStus 2.1 "multifile" declarations work in a
awkward way. A declaration of the form

      :- multifile pred/arity

should only occur in the first file loaded that contains definitions of
the predicate pred/arity.  In the Logical State Threads package the file
Source/versions.pl contain such a declaration for the predicate
'user:term_expansion/2'.  If you want to be able to load other files
containing clauses for 'user:term_expansion/2' prior to this one (which
is loaded automatically by the threads package) you should comment out
this declaration and make sure it occurs in some a file loaded before
this one.
