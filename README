nomads - a logical state thread for swi prolog

nomads is a library to allow you to do declarative programming with state.

this is a port of the original code for 'logical state threads' to swi prolog
which in turn was based on the EDCG work.  logical state threads were developed
by Andreas Kagedal and Peter van Roy.

It is best to think of it of it as a way to add mutable-like data to dcg's.
the idea is that you have named datatypes, with defined operators.

check examples/* to see this in action (lifted from the tutorial)

more information is avaliable in old/* and doc/*

the name was changed to avoid collisions with existing threading libraries.
